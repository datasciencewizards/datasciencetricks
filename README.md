We feel excited to launch the "Data Hack" series where we will present you with some well-known but less-addressed Data Science techniques in form short videos. Every video will focus on one of the concepts varying between - Machine Learning & Deep Learning Modeling, Data Manipulation, Visualization, Natural Language Processing, Optimization Techniques, Interesting Algorithms and much more. 

YouTube Playlist - http://tiny.cc/dsw-datahack-playlist

We aim to provide you hands-on knowledge of different concepts by giving you a proper run-through of the code. Also, any code used in the videos will be freely available on our Github repo in form of Jupyter notebooks.
